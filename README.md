# cs-capstone-final-project
Data science/machine learning capstone for my computer science degree.

# The project
The goal of the capstone project was to create a data product that addresses an organizational need using machine learning concepts.
My topic was: using linear regression to predict days to cell count recovery after blood or bone marrow transplant in children.
I have included my final writeup, in case there is any interest in the details, but I recommend the Quick Start Guide for a link to my final product.

# How to access the project
I have included a Word document which is a "Quick Start Guide" and has the Google Colab link to my project. 
Please note: My actual "data product" with a user interface is at the very bottom of the Google Colab notebook.
